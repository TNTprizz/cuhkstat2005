# How to Install SAS

## Step 1: Get a copy of the installation package
Attend the first lesson for the guide. Prepare a 64GB USB drive for that.  
You can buy a license as well if you are rich. ~~Buy me one also~~.

## Step 2: Install
**REFER TO THE PDF FILE PROVIDED IN THE INSTALLATION PACKAGE!!!**  
Something will not work if you don't do so.

## Step 3: Enjoy!

## Appendix: What if I am a Mac user?
The short answer is: Use the [web version](https://welcome.oda.sas.com/).

## But I want to install it onto my MacBook Pro!
***NO.***  
### Step 1: Install UTM
It is a free virtual machine software. Get it [here](https://mac.getutm.app/).

### Step 2: Get a copy of Windows ISO and license
Uhm. I of course *don't support* piracy.  
What I can tell you is, [this](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) is quite \*cough\* useful. Just remember to download the ARM version or you will be cooked.

### Step 3: Create a Windows 11 virtual machine
Virtualization -> Windows -> Pick the ISO file -> At least 8192 MB RAM + 4 cores -> 128 GB Storage -> Create a share folder -> Save.  
Now, Launch the machine by the play button. Do the installations.

### Step 4: Enjoy!

## QA

### I cannot use some functions after the installation!
This should not happen if you follow the guide included in the installation package provided by the school. Reinstall the entire thing by running the installation package again.

### The interface is ancient!
SAS Studio or the web version will do the job for you.

### The scroller of my mouse just reversed when using UTM!

### My computer broke after installing the entire thing!/It is not working!
None of my business, nor do I care. Google will help.
